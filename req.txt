- create a simple react+fastapi app(chat app)
- Use Docker to containerize your WebApp
– Store your Dockerfile and WebApp to Github
– Use CI/CD tool to automate the process
- Monitor logs using tools like prometheus,grafana or any better tool of your choice
- order these requirements based on your analysis.

---

## Current Progress

- Created a simple React frontend and a FastAPI backend for a chat application.
- Fixed a bug in the frontend React code that was causing an infinite loop.
- Implemented a simple "hi" -> "how are you/" communication channel to test the WebSocket connection.
- Verified that the frontend and backend can communicate with each other.
- Updated the frontend Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build for a smaller and more secure production image. The new Dockerfile uses `node:16-alpine` to build the React app and `nginx:stable-alpine` to serve the static files.
- Updated the backend Dockerfile to use a specific Python version, run as a non-root user, and set environment variables for better logging and security.
- Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the frontend and backend containers.
- Successfully built and ran the application using Docker Compose. The application is now running and accessible at http://localhost.
- Pushed the entire application, including Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml, to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/arulkn/democicd.git.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline will build and push the frontend and backend Docker images to GitHub Container Registry on every push to the `master` branch.

## Further Steps

- The CI/CD pipeline is set up to build and push images. The next step would be to add a deployment step to the pipeline, for example, to deploy the application to a cloud provider.
- Implement user authentication.
- Implement a feature to display a list of connected users.
- Implement message history.
- Set up monitoring for the application.
